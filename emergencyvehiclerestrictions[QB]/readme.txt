QBUS RESOURCE

emergency vehicles locked to jobs

drag and drop into resources rename to anything you want and ensure it

i do not take credit for any work uploaded.
free scripts i have found and pieced together to work for QBUS so am reuploading for users to use as they wish.. 
i am new to lua and fivem coding but am slowly learning so please

this is a script designed to restrict players who do not have Police Ambulance or Mechanic Job role in rp server
it will kick the driver of the emergency vehicle if they dont have one of the jobs whitelisted in the script.

use how you like i havent found one that works so i thought if i got one to i would upload for the rest of github :)
